#*WhitePages.com
Difficulty Rating: HARD

Search for your information on WhitePages.com by entering your first name, last name, city, and state. Note that WhitePages no longer lets you delete your information without registering for a WhitePages account.

Whitepages will also require you to confirm over the phone, which makes it impossible for us to remove these listings for you. If you speak with them, be sure to express your frustration.

Click your listing, and you'll be taken to a profile page with more of your personal info. Click the "Claim & Edit" button on this page.A window will pop up saying "You need to log in or create an account;" click the orange "Log In" button. You'll have to log in with Facebook (which we don't recommend), or create a new account with WhitePages. Click on the "Not interested in using Facebook" link to do this, then click the "create an account" link on the following page. You'll have to enter a first name, last name, email, and password. We recommend using a masked email to protect your personal email but still receive confirmation emails.

Fill out the information and click the "Create Account" button. You'll then see a screen asking you if you want to edit your listing (occasionally it will ask if you want to delete it--if you get that option, click it). Your strategy here is to edit all your information so it's either inaccurate (like "John Anonymous") or completely deleted. Go through each section editing your data and hitting the orange "update" button to save. You can also check the box under "HIDE" to hide your data, but we suggest anonymizing it in addition to hiding it. Once you've changed or deleted your data, you can refresh the page to see that your listing is gone.
